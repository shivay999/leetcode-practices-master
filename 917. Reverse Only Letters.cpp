/**
Given a string S, return the "reversed" string where all characters that are not a letter stay in the same place, and all letters reverse their positions.

 

Example 1:

Input: "ab-cd"
Output: "dc-ba"
Example 2:

Input: "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"
Output: "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"
Example 3:

Input: "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"
Output: "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"
 

Note:

S.length <= 100
33 <= S[i].ASCIIcode <= 122 
S doesn't contain \ or "
**/

/**
Approach 2: Reverse Pointer
Intuition

Write the characters of S one by one. 
When we encounter a letter, 
we want to write the next letter that occurs if we iterated through the string backwards.

So we do just that: 
keep track of a pointer j that iterates through the string backwards.
When we need to write a letter, we use it.

/**
Approach 1: Stack of Letters
Intuition and Algorithm
Collect the letters of S separately into a stack, 
so that popping the stack reverses the letters. 
(Alternatively, we could have collected the letters into an array and reversed the array.)
Then, when writing the characters of S, any time we need a letter, we use the one we have prepared instead.
