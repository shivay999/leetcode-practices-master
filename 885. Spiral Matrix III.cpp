/**
On a 2 dimensional grid with R rows and C columns, we start at (r0, c0) facing east.

Here, the north-west corner of the grid is at the first row and column, and the south-east corner of the grid is at the last row and column.

Now, we walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid. 

Whenever we would move outside the boundary of the grid, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.) 

Eventually, we reach all R * C spaces of the grid.

Return a list of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.

Example 1:

Input: R = 1, C = 4, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]

Example 2:

Input: R = 5, C = 6, r0 = 1, c0 = 4
Output: [[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],[3,4],[3,3],[3,2],[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[4,5],[4,4],[4,3],[4,2],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[4,0],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]]

Note:

1 <= R <= 100
1 <= C <= 100
0 <= r0 < R
0 <= c0 < C

/**
Approach 1: Walk in a Spiral
Intuition

We can walk in a spiral shape from the starting square, ignoring whether we stay in the grid or not. 
Eventually, we must have reached every square in the grid.

Algorithm

Examining the lengths of our walk in each direction, we find the following pattern: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, ... 
That is, we walk 1 unit east, then 1 unit south, then 2 units west, then 2 units north, then 3 units east, etc. 
Because our walk is self-similar, this pattern repeats in the way we expect.

After, the algorithm is straightforward: perform the walk and record positions of the grid in the order we visit them. 
Please read the inline comments for more details.

//Java
class Solution {
    public int[][] spiralMatrixIII(int R, int C, int r0, int c0) {
        int[] dr = new int[]{0, 1, 0, -1};
        int[] dc = new int[]{1, 0, -1, 0};

        int[][] ans = new int[R*C][2];
        int t = 0;

        ans[t++] = new int[]{r0, c0};
        if (R * C == 1) return ans;

        for (int k = 1; k < 2*(R+C); k += 2)
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {  // i: direction index
                int dk = k + (i / 2);  // number of steps in this direction
                for (int j = 0; j < dk; ++j) {  // for each step in this direction...
                    // step in the i-th direction
                    r0 += dr[i];
                    c0 += dc[i];
                    if (0 <= r0 && r0 < R && 0 <= c0 && c0 < C) {
                        ans[t++] = new int[]{r0, c0};
                        if (t == R * C) return ans;
                    }
                }
            }

        throw null;
    }
}

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O((max(R,C))^2). 
Potentially, our walk needs to spiral until we move RR in one direction, and CC in another direction, 
so as to reach every cell of the grid.

Space Complexity: O(Râˆ—C), the space used by the answer.
